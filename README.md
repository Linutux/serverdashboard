Server dashboard
=============

This is a simple and awesome dashboard for your own server. The dashboard require the functionality of shell_exec - they are mostly disabled on shared hosting systems. There is also a simple cache functionality included to prevent high loads on the system; the cache time can be setted in the top of the `assets/getStatus.php` file. JSON will be used to transfer data from the index and the PHP script.
Requirement: a (own?) server, PHP, a browser and some basic knowledge
